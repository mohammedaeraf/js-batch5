# üè´ Classroom Exercise 01

## Simple Phone Bill Calculator (Using If-Else)

---

### ‚úÖ **Objective:**

Practice using **if-else statements** in JavaScript to calculate a phone bill based on the number of calls.

---

### üìã **Instructions:**

1. Use a **hardcoded variable** `calls` to represent the number of phone calls made.

2. Write logic using **if-else** to calculate the total bill:

   - The first **100 calls are free**.
   - Every call **above 100 is charged 1 Rs per call**.

3. Print the result in this format:

   ```
   Number of calls: <number_of_calls>
   Total Bill: <calculated_bill> Rs
   ```

---

### ‚úÖ **Example Test Cases:**

#### Example 1:

```javascript
let calls = 80;
```

Expected Output:

```
Number of calls: 80
Total Bill: 0 Rs
```

#### Example 2:

```javascript
let calls = 150;
```

Expected Output:

```
Number of calls: 150
Total Bill: 50 Rs
```

#### Example 3:

```javascript
let calls = 200;
```

Expected Output:

```
Number of calls: 200
Total Bill: 100 Rs
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Sample Solution:**

```javascript
let calls = 150; // You can change this value to test different cases

let bill = 0;

if (calls <= 100) {
  bill = 0;
} else {
  bill = (calls - 100) * 1;
}

console.log("Number of calls:", calls);
console.log("Total Bill:", bill + " Rs");
```
