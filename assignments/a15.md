## ðŸ§© **Assignment 15: Exploring `forEach()` and the Spread Operator in JavaScript**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Objective:**

To understand and apply the **`forEach()`** method for iterating over arrays and the **spread operator (`...`)** for copying and combining arrays or objects.

---

## ðŸ“˜ **Part A: Understanding `forEach()`**

The `forEach()` method is used to execute a function for **each element** in an array.

---

### ðŸ§  **Task 1: Using `forEach()` with Simple Arrays**

1. Create an array named `fruits` containing at least **5 fruit names**.

   ```js
   let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango", "Grapes", "Orange"];
   ```
2. Use `forEach()` to:

   * Print each fruit name in **uppercase**.
   * Print a message like `"I like Mango"` for each fruit.
3. Create another array

   ```js
   let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
   ```

   * Use `forEach()` to print the **square** of each number.

---

### ðŸ§  **Task 2: Using `forEach()` with an Array of Objects**

1. Create an array of **student objects**:

   ```js
   let students = [
     { name: "Aisha", marks: 85 },
     { name: "Rahul", marks: 92 },
     { name: "Meena", marks: 78 },
   ];
   ```
2. Use `forEach()` to:

   * Print each studentâ€™s name and marks in a formatted message like
     `"Aisha scored 85 marks"`.
   * Calculate and print the **average marks** using a variable (`totalMarks`) updated inside the loop.

ðŸ’¡ *Hint:* Initialize `totalMarks = 0` before the loop and divide by `students.length` at the end.

---

## ðŸ“˜ **Part B: Exploring the Spread Operator (`...`)**

The spread operator allows you to **expand** arrays or objects â€” useful for copying or merging.

---

### ðŸ§  **Task 3: Using Spread Operator with Arrays**

1. Create two arrays:

   ```js
   let frontend = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"];
   let backend = ["Node.js", "Express", "MongoDB"];
   ```
2. Combine both arrays into one new array named `fullStack` using the spread operator.
3. Add one more element `"React"` at the end of the combined array using the spread operator.
4. Print all arrays to the console.

---

### ðŸ§  **Task 4: Using Spread Operator with Objects**

1. Create an object:

   ```js
   let student = { name: "Aisha", age: 21 };
   ```
2. Create another object `studentDetails` that includes all properties of `student` plus:

   ```js
   { course: "Full Stack Development", city: "Mangalore" }
   ```
3. Print both objects to the console.

---

## ðŸ’¡ **Bonus Task (Optional):**

* Use the spread operator to make a **copy of an array**, modify one element, and show that the **original array remains unchanged**.

  ```js
  let colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"];
  let newColors = [...colors];
  newColors.push("Yellow");
  ```

---

## ðŸ§¾ **Expected Output Example:**

```
I like Apple
I like Banana
APPLE
BANANA
MANGO

Square of 10 = 100
Square of 20 = 400
Square of 30 = 900

Aisha scored 85 marks
Rahul scored 92 marks
Meena scored 78 marks
Average Marks = 85

Full Stack Array: [ 'HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'Node.js', 'Express', 'MongoDB', 'React' ]
Student Details: { name: 'Aisha', age: 21, course: 'Full Stack Development', city: 'Mangalore' }

Original Colors: [ 'Red', 'Green', 'Blue' ]
Copied Colors: [ 'Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Yellow' ]
```
