## **Assignment 11: Update Course Prices**

Write a JavaScript program that performs the following operations on a list of **courses**.

#### **Instructions:**

1. Create an array named `courses` containing at least **4 course objects**.
   Each course should have the following properties:

   * `title`
   * `duration`
   * `price`

2. Using the `map()` function, create a **new array** named `updatedCourses` where
   the **price of each course is reduced by ₹2000**.

3. Finally, print the **updated course list** using `console.log()`.

### **Example Structure**

```javascript
let courses = [
  { title: "Full Stack Development", duration: "6 Months", price: 18000 },
  { title: "Data Science", duration: "5 Months", price: 20000 },
  { title: "AWS Cloud", duration: "3 Months", price: 15000 },
  { title: "UI/UX Design", duration: "4 Months", price: 16000 },
];

// Reduce each course price by ₹2000
console.log("Updated Course Prices:", updatedCourses);
```

---

### **Expected Output**

```
Updated Course Prices: [
  { title: 'Full Stack Development', duration: '6 Months', price: 16000 },
  { title: 'Data Science', duration: '5 Months', price: 18000 },
  { title: 'AWS Cloud', duration: '3 Months', price: 13000 },
  { title: 'UI/UX Design', duration: '4 Months', price: 14000 }
]
```
