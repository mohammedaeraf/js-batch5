## 📝 **Assignment 04: Loops & Conditionals**

### 🎯 **Objective:**

Practice using `for` loops and `if / else` statements to solve real-world-style problems.

---

### ✅ **Problem 1: Determine Even or Odd**

**Task:**
Write a program to loop through numbers from **1 to 20**, and print:

- `"Even"` if the number is even
- `"Odd"` if the number is odd

**Expected Output (partial):**

```
1 is Odd
2 is Even
3 is Odd
...
20 is Even
```

#### 💡 **Hints:**

- Use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 20.
- Use the modulus operator `%` to check if a number is even (`num % 2 == 0`) or odd.

### ✅ **Problem 2: FizzBuzz Variation**

**Task:**
Loop through numbers from **1 to 50** and:

- Print `"Fizz"` if the number is divisible by 3
- Print `"Buzz"` if divisible by 5
- Print `"FizzBuzz"` if divisible by both 3 and 5
- Otherwise, print the number itself

**Expected Output (partial):**

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
...
FizzBuzz
```

#### 💡 **Hints:**

- Use a `for` loop from 1 to 50.
- Use `if / else if / else` conditions to check divisibility by 3 and 5.
- Remember the order of checks matters (check divisible by both 3 and 5 first).
