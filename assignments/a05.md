## 📝 Assignment 05: Apply Discounts

### 🎯 Objective:

Practice **conditional logic with switch-case** in JavaScript.

---

### ✅ Problem Statement

A shop gives discounts based on **coupon codes**:

* `"DISC5"` → **5% discount**
* `"DISC10"` → **10% discount**
* `"DISC20"` → **20% discount**
* No coupon → **No discount**

**Task:**
Write a program in JavaScript to:

1. Start with a **hardcoded bill total** (e.g., `let total = 2000;`).
2. Use a **coupon code** (hardcoded, e.g., `"DISC10"`).
3. Apply the discount based on the coupon.
4. Display:

   * Original Bill
   * Coupon Code
   * Final Bill after discount

---

### 💡 Hints

* Use a **`switch(couponCode)`** statement instead of multiple `if–else`.
* Remember: Final Bill = `total - (total * discountPercent / 100)`

---

### 🖥️ Sample Expected Output

If `total = 2000` and `couponCode = "DISC10"`, output should be:

```
Original Bill: 2000
Coupon Applied: DISC10
Final Bill after Discount: 1800
```
