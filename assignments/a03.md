## üìù **Assignment 03: Electricity Bill Calculation in Java/JavaScript**

---

### ‚úÖ **Objective:**

Practice using **conditional statements** to calculate an electricity bill based on slab rates.

---

### üìã **Instructions:**

1. Use the following **hardcoded values**:

   * `name = "John Doe"`
   * `cons_no = 101`
   * `unit = 350`

2. Write a JavaScript program that calculates the electricity bill based on the following **slab rates**:

   | Units Consumed             | Rate per Unit |
   | -------------------------- | ------------- |
   | Up to 100 units            | 1.50 Rs/unit  |
   | Next 100 units (101 - 200) | 2.50 Rs/unit  |
   | Next 200 units (201 - 400) | 3.50 Rs/unit  |
   | Above 400 units            | 4.00 Rs/unit  |

3. Print the result in the following format:

   ```
   Consumer Name: John Doe  
   Consumer No: 101  
   Units Consumed: 350  
   Bill Amount: 825 Rs
   ```

### ‚úÖ **Test Cases to Try:**

* `unit = 50`
* `unit = 150`
* `unit = 450`
