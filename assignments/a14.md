## **Assignment 14: Working with Arrays of Objects â€“ Products Inventory**

### **Objective:**

To strengthen your understanding of array methods (`forEach`, `filter`, and `reduce`) by working with a list of products in a store or warehouse.

---

### **Problem Statement:**

You are managing an inventory system for an electronics store. The store sells multiple products like Laptops, Mice, and Monitors.
Each product has the following details:

- `name` â†’ product name
- `price` â†’ product price in â‚¹
- `stock` â†’ number of items available in stock

Perform various operations on the product list using JavaScript array methods.

---

### **Starter Code:**

```javascript
let products = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 900, stock: 20 },
  { name: "Mouse", price: 25, stock: 100 },
  { name: "Monitor", price: 150, stock: 50 },
];
```

---

### **Assignment Tasks:**

1. Add **two more products** (like Keyboard and Headphones) to the `products` array.
2. Modify the program to print all products **using `console.table()`** for better visualization.
3. Filter and display **only affordable products** (price below â‚¹100).
4. Calculate and print the **average price** of all products.
5. Use `map()` to create a new array containing only the **names** of all products.
6. Display the **total number of products** in stock (sum of all `stock` values).

---

### **Bonus Tasks (Optional):**

ðŸ’¡ Try the following for extra practice:

- Sort the products by `price` in ascending order.
- Find the product with the **highest stock**.
- Print a formatted report like:
  `"Laptop (â‚¹900) - Stock: 20 - Total Value: â‚¹18000"` for each product.

---

### **Expected Output Example:**

```
Laptop: â‚¹900
Mouse: â‚¹25
Monitor: â‚¹150
Expensive Products: [ { name: 'Laptop', price: 900, stock: 20 }, { name: 'Monitor', price: 150, stock: 50 } ]
Total Value of Inventory in Warehouse = â‚¹25500
```
