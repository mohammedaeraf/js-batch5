## **Assignment 14: Working with Arrays of Objects – Products Inventory**

### **Objective:**

To strengthen your understanding of JavaScript array methods — particularly `forEach()`, `filter()`, `map()`, and `reduce()` — by managing a list of products in a store or warehouse.

---

### **Problem Statement:**

You are managing an inventory system for an electronics store.
The store sells multiple products like Laptops, Mice, and Monitors.

Each product has the following details:

* `name` → product name
* `price` → product price in ₹
* `stock` → number of items available in stock

You will perform various operations on the product list using JavaScript array methods.

---

### **Starter Code:**

```javascript
let products = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 900, stock: 20 },
  { name: "Mouse", price: 25, stock: 100 },
  { name: "Monitor", price: 150, stock: 50 },
];
```

---

### **Assignment Tasks:**

1. Add **two more products** (e.g., Keyboard and Headphones) to the `products` array.
2. Display all products in a **tabular format** using `console.table()`.
3. Filter and display **only affordable products** (price below ₹100).
4. Calculate and print the **average price** of all products.
5. Use `map()` to create a new array containing only the **names** of all products.
6. Use `reduce()` to calculate and display the **total stock count** (sum of all `stock` values).

---

### **Bonus Task (Optional):**

💡 Try the following for extra practice:

* Print a formatted report like:
  `"Laptop (₹900) - Stock: 20 - Total Value: ₹18000"` for each product.

---

### **Expected Output Example:**

```
Product List:
┌─────────┬─────────────┬───────┬───────┐
│ (index) │ name        │ price │ stock │
├─────────┼─────────────┼───────┼───────┤
│    0    │ 'Laptop'    │  900  │  20   │
│    1    │ 'Mouse'     │  25   │ 100   │
│    2    │ 'Monitor'   │  150  │  50   │
│    3    │ 'Keyboard'  │  45   │  60   │
│    4    │ 'Headphones'│  80   │  40   │
└─────────┴─────────────┴───────┴───────┘

Affordable Products: [ { name: 'Mouse', price: 25, stock: 100 }, { name: 'Keyboard', price: 45, stock: 60 }, { name: 'Headphones', price: 80, stock: 40 } ]
Average Price of Products = ₹240
Total Stock Available = 270
```
