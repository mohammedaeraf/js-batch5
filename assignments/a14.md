## **Assignment 14: Working with Arrays of Objects – Products Inventory**

### **Objective:**

To strengthen your understanding of array methods (`forEach`, `filter`, and `reduce`) by working with a list of products in a store or warehouse.

---

### **Problem Statement:**

You are managing an inventory system for an electronics store. The store sells multiple products like Laptops, Mice, and Monitors.
Each product has the following details:

* `name` → product name
* `price` → product price in ₹
* `stock` → number of items available in stock

Perform various operations on the product list using JavaScript array methods.

---

### **Starter Code:**

```javascript
let products = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 900, stock: 20 },
  { name: "Mouse", price: 25, stock: 100 },
  { name: "Monitor", price: 150, stock: 50 },
];

// 1️⃣ Print name and price of each product
products.forEach((p) => {
  console.log(`${p.name}: ₹${p.price}`);
});

// 2️⃣ Filter products above ₹100
let expensive = products.filter((p) => p.price > 100);
console.log("Expensive Products:", expensive);

// 3️⃣ Find total value of inventory in warehouse/store
let inventoryValue = products.reduce(
  (total, product) => total + product.price * product.stock,
  0
);
console.log(`Total Value of Inventory in Warehouse = ₹${inventoryValue}`);
```

---

### **Assignment Tasks:**

1. Add **two more products** (like Keyboard and Headphones) to the `products` array.
2. Modify the program to print all products **using `console.table()`** for better visualization.
3. Filter and display **only affordable products** (price below ₹100).
4. Calculate and print the **average price** of all products.
5. Use `map()` to create a new array containing only the **names** of all products.
6. Display the **total number of products** in stock (sum of all `stock` values).

---

### **Bonus Tasks (Optional):**

💡 Try the following for extra practice:

* Sort the products by `price` in ascending order.
* Find the product with the **highest stock**.
* Print a formatted report like:
  `"Laptop (₹900) - Stock: 20 - Total Value: ₹18000"` for each product.

---

### **Expected Output Example:**

```
Laptop: ₹900
Mouse: ₹25
Monitor: ₹150
Expensive Products: [ { name: 'Laptop', price: 900, stock: 20 }, { name: 'Monitor', price: 150, stock: 50 } ]
Total Value of Inventory in Warehouse = ₹25500
```
