## 📝 **Assignment: Pattern Printing with For Loops in JavaScript**

---

### ✅ **Objective:**

Practice using **nested for loops** in JavaScript to print different number and star patterns.

---

### 🚀 **Programs to Implement:**

---

### ✅ **Pattern 1: Increasing Numbers**

Print the following pattern:

```
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4

### ✅ **Bonus Task (Optional):**

- Add comments in your code explaining the role of each loop.
- Experiment by changing the number of rows.

---

### ✅ **Submission Instructions:**

- Write each pattern printing logic as a separate function in a `.js` file.
- Test your code in Node.js or a browser console.
- Submit the `.js` file or share your GitHub link.
