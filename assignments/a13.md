## ðŸ§© **Assignment 13: Student Records and Array Functions**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Objective:**

Understand how to work with arrays of objects and use important array methods like
`for...of`, `forEach()`, `filter()`, `map()`, and `reduce()` in JavaScript.

---

### ðŸ§± **Problem Description:**

You are asked to create a **Student Management Program** that stores details of students and performs various operations such as filtering toppers, listing names, and calculating total marks.

---

### ðŸ§  **Task Instructions:**

1. **Create an array of student objects** named `students`.
   Each student should have the following properties:

   * `name`
   * `age`
   * `marks`

   Example:

   ```js
   let students = [
     { name: "Ali", age: 18, marks: 85 },
     { name: "Zara", age: 19, marks: 92 },
     { name: "John", age: 17, marks: 78 },
   ];
   ```

---

2. **Print each student's name and marks** using a `for...of` loop.

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Ali scored 85
   Zara scored 92
   John scored 78
   ```

---

3. **Find and display toppers** using the `filter()` method.

   * A topper is a student with marks **greater than 80**.

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Toppers: [{ name: "Ali", age: 18, marks: 85 }, { name: "Zara", age: 19, marks: 92 }]
   ```

---

4. **Create an array of student names** using the `map()` method.

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   ["Ali", "Zara", "John"]
   ```

---

5. **Calculate the total marks** of all students using the `reduce()` method.

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Total Marks: 255
   ```

---

### ðŸ§© **Bonus Challenge:**

* Find the **average marks** of the students.
* Print a message such as:

  ```
  Average Marks = 85
  ```

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Hint:**

You can calculate the average using:

```js
let avg = totalMarks / students.length;
```
